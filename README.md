# Overcoat.js
Overcoat.js is a jQuery plugin that adds custom overlays to portions of a site. Data attributes are used to configure overcoat. See [documentation](http://codeshoppe.io/overcoat) for the list of options.

One of the key features of Overcoat.js is the ability for overcoats to resize as the browser windows resizes. Bacon.js is used to throttle how often overcoat responds to window resize events to avoid performance issues.
